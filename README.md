# swc-jest

A library for testing TypeScript and JavaScript using SWC and Jest. SWC is an extensible Rust-based platform used for both compilation and bundling. JavaScript is a testing framework. This library can bootstrap a project with default configurations and allows you to customize settings in a non-proprietary way. This library is designed to be used as a dependency in a project. It is not designed to be used as a standalone project. If you have suggestions or have any problems, please open an issue on the [d-leb/swc-jest issues board](https://github.com/d-leb/swc-jest/issues).
